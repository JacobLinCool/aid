export const WIKI_AI = `Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. "AI" may also refer to the machines themselves.

AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategy games (such as chess and Go).

Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment and loss of funding, but after 2012, when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, there was a vast increase in funding and interest.

The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and many other fields.`;

		`I remember when I was a freshman in junior high school, I participated in a piano contest held by our school. It was sure lucky enough for me to knock out all the other opponents and win the first place. For the great efforts I had paid in preparing this contest, my parents bought me a splendid mountain bike which I'd always been longing for. My parents don't always give me rewards when I've done something well, that's why I was so astonished that I could actually get such a big prize from them.

    In my opinion, giving your children some kinds of rewards once in a while has a 2 significant meaning to your children. Buying something they want for them when they've achieved a certain goal can actually give them a sense of honor and a great sense of achievement, just like my parents did. Needless to say, when I have my own children, I will definitely make sure that they will always receive the best compliment and the warmest reward from their most caring parents when they've done something decent.`,
		`內容豐富，適切表達題目重點；組織良好，先舉例說明，再闡述父母適度獎勵對孩子 的意義。雖偶有錯誤(例如兩個完整句之間使用逗號"My parents don't always give me rewards…, that's why I was….")，但能使用較精確的字彙及多樣的句型作深入表達，行 文流暢。`,

		`The old proverb says "hard work brings success". When you are doing well at school and get good grades, fathers and mothers often give you some awards or gifts to encourage you to work harder, chimb to the higher level. In my opinion, I think it is really useful in me because I am exactly the one who need good words and encouragement. For example, when I passed the senior high school entrance test and became a member of the talent class. My parents sent me to U.S.A. for a vocation. It is not only their love at me, but also to make me know that it is worth to study hard, and discovered that study is fun. So, when I grow up and become a father of some children, I will still use my "old-fasion" way to make my children study hard. And let them know that this is not only for wealth or gifts, but for the award that you have won the fight against yourself.`,
		`內容符合題目要求。標點使用有誤，例如 when 子句與後面主要子句之間應用逗點， 卻用了句點("For example, when I passed…. My parents….")；連接詞使用不佳("It is not only their love at me, but also to….")；拼字亦有誤("chimb"，"vocation"和"fasion")。整 體而言，雖有錯誤，但全篇通順，組織完整，用字遣詞大致良好，達通過標準。`,

		`When I get good grades or good at behavior, my parents usually say "This is your responsible, you should do well." or "That's not bad and make progress next time." They never give me money or gifts. I think that the way of encourage is great and reasonable. I sometimes feel that they are vitally strict to me. If I am be mother, I'll use the same way to encourage my child. And give him(her) right thinking. This is because that I saw many parents give money or presents too much. I think they are over-love their child. And this way was very bad. They study in order to earn things which they like from their parents, not study in truth.`,
		`內容大致符合題目要求，組織尚可，但用詞、文法常有誤，致詞不達意，例如"good at behavior"，"your responsible"，"the way of encourage"及"study in truth"等，句構尚未能 完全掌握，例如"If I am be mother"以及"they are over-love their child"等，影響理解。`,

		`Depend on what I thinking, my behavior presentation is excellent. When I was a child, I never let my parents worry about. They open their mind, democrace thought and give a big space to me. They always encourage on oral, never scold. Sometimes buy a gift for prize. I feeling no pressure, it is great. I will get married someday, I will do the same way as my parents to treat my child. And I hope my child will thanks me in the future.`,
		`內容未完全切合題目的提示，題目重點是「父母獎勵孩子的方式」，但此篇主要在說 明父母的管教方式，對於獎勵方式只稍微點到。組織鬆散，基本句構有誤，例如"what I thinking"，"Sometimes buy a gift for prize."及"I feeling no pressure"等；文法及用字錯 誤甚多，例如"behavior presentation" 和"democrace thought"，以致未能達意。此外， 本篇作文字數只有 84 字，未達題目要求，亦為失分因素。`,
